##Smart India Hackathon 2023

##Aim of the Project

This model works on the principle of automated or self driving vehicles available in the market.
The camera sensor can be monitored at real time and 2 major objectives i.e. Accident Alert and Road damage alert can be implemented.
The ML model can be trained with the images of Accident photos/Data and Road damage types.
The trained model can be utilised for alerting the ambulance and police in case of an accident and construction management in case of road damage.
Progressive learning can also be implemented to achieve more accuracy.


## About the project
Machine learning like models like Regressions and Decision tree can be utilised.
Deep learning algorithms like CNN and tools like TensorFlow can be used.
Hardware tools like Real time cameras , object sensors , transmitters and receivers can be used.
Smart city mechanism can help to ensure Woman safety as well by dividing the roads with main stations at limited distance which will also work as power source for the real time monitoring.
